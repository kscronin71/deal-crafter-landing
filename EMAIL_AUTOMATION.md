## Integration with Email Services

### Current Implementation
The system currently logs emails to the console. To integrate with real email services:

### SendGrid Integration
```javascript
// In scripts/send-automated-emails.js
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

async function sendEmail(email, template) {
  const msg = {
    to: email,
    from: 'noreply@dealcrafter.ai',
    subject: template.subject,
    text: template.body,
    html: template.body.replace(/\n/g, '<br>')
  };
  
  try {
    await sgMail.send(msg);
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('SendGrid error:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

### Mailgun Integration
```javascript
// In scripts/send-automated-emails.js
const formData = require('form-data');
const Mailgun = require('mailgun.js');
const mailgun = new Mailgun(formData);
const mg = mailgun.client({username: 'api', key: process.env.MAILGUN_API_KEY});

async function sendEmail(email, template) {
  const data = {
    from: 'Deal Crafter AI <noreply@dealcrafter.ai>',
    to: email,
    subject: template.subject,
    text: template.body
  };
  
  try {
    await mg.messages.create(process.env.MAILGUN_DOMAIN, data);
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Mailgun error:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Email Service (choose one)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
```

## Data Structure

### Signup Object
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "source": "hero-section",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-05T12:00:00.000Z",
  "id": "1704456000000",
  "status": "early-access",
  "paidAt": null,

- Include clear next steps
- Use social proof and testimonials
- Provide support contact information

### 3. Segmentation
- Different content for early access vs paid users
- Track engagement and adjust sequences
- A/B test subject lines and content

### 4. Compliance
- Include unsubscribe links
- Respect email frequency preferences
- Follow GDPR and CAN-SPAM regulations

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
- Email open rates
- Click-through rates
- Conversion rates (early access â†’ paid)
- Time to first login (paid users)
- Support ticket volume

### Dashboard Features
- Real-time signup tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Emails not sending**: Check API keys and service configuration
2. **Duplicate emails**: System prevents duplicate sends via tracking
3. **Missing user data**: Ensure signup API is working correctly
4. **Scheduling issues**: Verify cron job configuration

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG_EMAILS=true
```

This will log all email operations to the console for troubleshooting.
